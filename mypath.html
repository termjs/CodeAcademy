                <p>Setting direction is one of the most important things you’ll do when building a product and company.
                    A clear direction aligns everyone to work toward the same goals. It helps individuals make daily
                    decisions, teams prioritize projects and all members of your organization feel motivated toward a
                    shared purpose. Without direction, it’s harder to work together, know what to focus on and make
                    meaningful progress.</p>

                <div class="path-name data-name paragraph-path">
                    <p>Roadmaps are a critical tool for shaping this direction. The process of creating a roadmap forces
                        you
                        to articulate a vision and decide how to build toward it. The culminating roadmap sets a path of
                        execution for the near future, slightly in front of you and ideally a bit out of reach. Anyone
                        in
                        your company can look at the roadmap to quickly understand what to work on and why it matters. A
                        glance at the roadmap reveals progress clearly and can help you identify projects that need
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>Whether you’re part of a three-person startup or one thousand employee company, a roadmap helps
                        you
                        and everyone you work with make better decisions more quickly and focus on more valuable work.
                        Clear
                        roadmaps keep teams aligned even when individuals work independently. Ambitious roadmaps push
                        people
                        to challenge themselves to do their best work. Visible roadmaps motivate individuals by giving
                        them
                        context on why their work matters and create a culture of transparency that builds trust, making
                        collaboration easier and even spurring it serendipitously.</p>
                    <p>These are the practices to follow when building and managing a roadmap:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Invest in planning</li>
                        <li>Work on substantial projects</li>
                        <li>Prioritize for impact</li>
                        <li>Review regularly</li>
                        <li>Stay flexible</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span id="start-3" class="link-place"></span>
                    <a href="#start-3" class="path-link">
                        <h1>Work on substantial projects</h1>
                    </a>
                    <p>There are different ways to plan out the roadmap. You'll probably choose a small group of company
                        leaders to build it, unless you're small enough that you can run an effective planning meeting
                        if the full team participates. Carve out meaningful time before your first meeting together to
                        think through company goals and what parts of the product you want to improve most. Use your
                        product intuition. Review customer feedback and feature requests. It's also important to review
                        company metrics such as sign up, activation, retention and revenue so you know how to make
                        trade-offs between features and whether specific areas of the app should be prioritized higher
                        than others.</p>
                    <p>While you'll build the initial roadmap with a small team, people like to feel included and will
                        feel more ownership if they participate in the planning process in some way. Give everyone a
                        chance to contribute. Let teams propose their own projects and you may even set a window of time
                        for anyone to submit feedback and ideas. Also, talk to your customers. Reach out to customers
                        who have asked for features you're considering prioritizing, especially if you're unclear on the
                        customer need or scope of the project. However you plan your roadmap, it’s helpful to timebox
                        the process and develop a repeatable structure so it becomes easier to create over time.</p>
                    <span id="start-4" class="link-place"></span>
                    <a href="#start-4" class="path-link">
                        <h1>Invest in planning</h1>
                    </a>
                    <p>Ideally, the projects you choose to work on make concrete progress in some way. They may create
                        new functionality, launch a campaign or improve an existing area of the product. Build features
                        to completion and avoid breaking down projects into chunks so small that progress doesn’t feel
                        meaningful. Some projects have to get done no matter what such as building tooling and
                        documentation, so fit these into the roadmap and use them to balance out the type and intensity
                        of work. Sometimes teams will also bundle smaller issues into a project to make it more fun. For
                        example, you could create a project called bug week where the focus would be to work through
                        priority bugs from the backlog.</p>

                    <span id="start-5" class="link-place"></span>
                    <a href="#start-5" class="path-link">
                        <h1>The end of time</h1>
                    </a>
                    <p>Use higher-level milestones to help focus work toward more meaningful projects. Prioritize
                        foundational projects first and those that will have the greatest impact on the customer
                        experience. Deprioritize projects that don’t improve the product for customers, help you hit
                        company targets or increase the quality and speed of work.</p>
                    <p>Once you have a list of projects to work on, adjust the sequence as needed to juggle teammate
                        availability as well as project intensity. Work on a couple of smaller projects after shipping a
                        larger feature to avoid burnout. Rotate project leads so top performers don't feel overburdened
                        and everyone gets a chance to develop project management skills. You should work on as few
                        projects at a time both as a team and as individuals. Ship existing projects before starting new
                        ones. Focus produces higher quality work and shipping builds execution into a habit. Order
                        projects so new work builds on top of previous projects which will make changes feel organic and
                        can have compounding effects. It’s also better to ship three significant projects than to end
                        the roadmap with ten half-completed ones.</p>
